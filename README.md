# Flight Delay Prediction Project

## Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis and pipeline development using Databricks to predict flight delays. The project is divided into three phases, each with specific deliverables and requirements. The final submission will be a Databricks notebook summarizing the team's work and findings.

## Phase Descriptions and Deliverables

### Phase I: Project Plan
**Objectives**: Describe datasets, joins, tasks, and metrics.  
**Tasks**: Perform exploratory analysis, identify missing/corrupt data, define outcomes, and summarize datasets.  
**Deliverables**: Project notebook.

### Phase II: EDA & Baseline Pipeline
**Objectives**: Conduct EDA, build baseline pipeline, and perform feature engineering.  
**Tasks**: Address missing data, handle non-numerical features, implement feature transformations, create baseline models, and evaluate metrics.  
**Deliverables**: Project notebook, in-class presentation.

### Phase III: Algorithm Selection & Fine-Tuning
**Objectives**: Select and fine-tune the optimal algorithm.  
**Tasks**: Experiment with sophisticated models, report evaluation metrics, conduct hyperparameter tuning, and pursue novel approaches.  
**Deliverables**: Final notebook, final presentation.
