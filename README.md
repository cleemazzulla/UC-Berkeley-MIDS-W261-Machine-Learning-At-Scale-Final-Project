++**Flight Delay Prediction Project**

**Overview**

This project involves a comprehensive analysis and pipeline development using Databricks to predict flight delays. The project is divided into three phases, each with specific deliverables and requirements. The final submission will be a Databricks notebook summarizing the team's work and findings.

**Phase Descriptions and Deliverables**

Phase I: Project Plan
Objectives: Describe datasets, joins, tasks, and metrics.
Tasks: Perform exploratory analysis, identify missing/corrupt data, define outcomes, and summarize datasets.


Phase II: EDA & Baseline Pipeline
Objectives: Conduct EDA, build baseline pipeline, and perform feature engineering.
Tasks: Address missing data, handle non-numerical features, implement feature transformations, create baseline models, and evaluate metrics.

Phase III: Algorithm Selection & Fine-Tuning
Objectives: Select and fine-tune the optimal algorithm.
Tasks: Experiment with sophisticated models, report evaluation metrics, conduct hyperparameter tuning, and pursue novel approaches.


Deliverables: Final notebook with all findings and final model.
