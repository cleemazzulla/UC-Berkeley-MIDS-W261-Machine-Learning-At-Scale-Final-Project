##Project Summary

#Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis and pipeline development using Databricks to predict flight delays. The project is divided into three phases, each with specific deliverables and requirements. The final submission will be a Databricks notebook summarizing the team's work and findings.

#Phase Descriptions and Deliverables
Phase I: Project Plan

Objectives: Describe datasets, joins, tasks, and metrics.
Tasks: Perform exploratory analysis, identify missing/corrupt data, define outcomes, and summarize datasets.
Deliverables: Project notebook.

#Phase II: EDA & Baseline Pipeline

Objectives: Conduct EDA, build baseline pipeline, and perform feature engineering.
Tasks: Address missing data, handle non-numerical features, implement feature transformations, create baseline models, and evaluate metrics.
Deliverables: Project notebook, in-class presentation.

#Phase III: Algorithm Selection & Fine-Tuning

Objectives: Select and fine-tune the optimal algorithm.
Tasks: Experiment with sophisticated models, report evaluation metrics, conduct hyperparameter tuning, and pursue novel approaches.
Deliverables: Final notebook, final presentation.
